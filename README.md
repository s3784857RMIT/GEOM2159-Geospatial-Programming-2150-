# GEOM2159-Geospatial-Programming-2150-
GitHub site for Semester 2 Geospatial Programming Final Project

The two codes that are brought into this GitHub Folder today are apart of the entire Final Project. 

The first python file, is a file that contains a process for determining roads, as an environmental factor affecting Koalas. 

The lines of code within the file are processes of each step according to my filepaths, you will need to replace the filepaths with your own.

The code is ONLY designed for ARCGIS Pro as it uses the extension: arcpy.

The second python file, is a file that creates a scatterplot graph according to the data that you processed through the first python file. 
Extensions pandas, matplotlib.pyplot and scipy.stats are used.

The shapefile 'shortened_roads.shp' is a clipped version of the roads shapefile originally from the GEODATA TOPO 250K Series 3 data. (C) Copyright Commonwealth of Australia  (Geoscience Australia) 2006

The CSV file contains 20 study sites that recorded the number of Koalas encountered around the site. It also has the Longitude & Latitude coordinates of those sites.

I also provided the excel spreadsheet if anything happens to the first half of the python code.
