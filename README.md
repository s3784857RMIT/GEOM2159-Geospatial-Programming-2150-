GitHub site for Semester 2 Geospatial Programming Final project

The two codes that are brought into this GitHub Folder today are apart of the entire Final Project. 

The first python file, is a file that contains a process for determining roads, as an environmental factor affecting Koalas. 

The lines of code within the file are processes of each step according to my filepaths, you will need to replace the filepaths with your own.

The code is ONLY designed for ARCGIS Pro as it uses the extension: arcpy.

The second python file, is a file that creates a scatterplot graph according to the data that you processed through the first python file. 
Extensions pandas, matplotlib.pyplot and scipy.stats are used.
